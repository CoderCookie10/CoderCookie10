My name is Emma Gao. I am 11 years old, and I am interested in how the brain recognises faces and how the frontal lobe works on the neuronal level. 
I am investigating the causes of certain diseases, like Alzheimer's and Schizophrenia.

Apart from neuroscience, I also enjoy Coding and Electronics. 
I code mainly in Python on replit.com (I am known as EmmaGao8 on replit.com). 
I developed a liking for Soldering/Welding. I made a robotic arm that can you can control with a joystick.

I am amazed by the beauty of math and the nature of everything. 
I learn mathematics on AoPS and I am known there as SmallStone9. As hobbies, I play Cello and Chess. 
I am currently on 1/2 for Cello and I am in 4th grade. I practice my Chess on Lichess.
